# idb-bot
Idle bot for the Idle Big Devil game.
Runs like any other macro-bot by controlling input for you.

Currently there's only one mode: arena bot. 
In this mode the bot tries to climb up the arena ladder by selecting opponents with power lower than yours (maximally 90% of your power). That guarantees good win/loss ratio.
